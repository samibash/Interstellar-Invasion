## TITLE:

Interstellar-Invasion

## DESCRIPTION:

This is an in-browser game based on the popular arcade game, Space Invaders. The objective of this game is to eliminate all of the alien invaders, which are in a group right above you, to achieve the highest score possible; while simultaneously avoiding the invaders’ own attacks on you as you only have 3 lives. You can attack the aliens by pressing the space bar, and a projectile will shoot upwards into them. The aliens will randomly shoot projectiles at you as well.



## TECHNOLOGIES USED:

I’ll be using the canvas element to set a dynamic background for both the user spaceship and the group of alien spaceships to fly over. I was thinking of creating a black background with series of moving white “stars”.
I’ll also be using a “sprite image” or “sprite sheet” for my projectile — a sprite image is basically a single image file that has a series of drawings within that single file. So feasibly the sprite image would be repeating itself looking like it’s “traveling” across the screen. I'll also utilize the keycodes for the spacebar (for the projectiles); and the keycodes for the left and right arrow keys.



## MAJOR PROBLEMS:

I think the biggest challenge for me would be trying to learn the new concepts i need to learn to implement code within 4 days, since there are a lot of components and code to this game that i’m unfamiliar with (like implementing my sprite image projectile; and creating a dynamic “space-themed” canvas to underlay everything on).



## POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:

Psuedocoding everything. Breaking down macro level problems like, i want a projectile to shoot from my spaceship into the alien spaceships, into smaller more manageable ones like, what makes a projectile? a sprite image. How do i create a sprite image? I create or search an image of a “missile” that has multiple images of itself in a single file.
How do i create the alien spaceships? Create a div within a div that contains a sprite image of alien spaceships.
